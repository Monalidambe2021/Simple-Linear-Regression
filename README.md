# Simple-Linear-Regression
Linear regression to predict salary based on years of experience. Here in the dataset there are two columns "YearExperiance" and "Salary". Here "Salary" is dependent variable and "YearExpeiance" is independent varaible. I have used linear regression because data seems to be linearly distributed. I got here approximately  95% accuracy.
